## Code Challenge | Stacks and Queues

### Challenge Description
Stacks and queues is really similar to the linked lists code challenges, and in fact, does leverage the same structure as linked lists. In this code challenge, we were to write three methods for each Stacks and Queues. They were .push(), .pop(), and .peek() for Stacks, and .enqueue(), .dequeue(), and .peek() for Queues. 

### Approach & Efficiency
My approach to this was really similar to what we did for linked lists, so I leveraged that work pretty significantly, just following the same logic.
