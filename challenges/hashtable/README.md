## Code Challenge | Hash Table
The goal was to successfully create a hash table class, that instantiated a hash table consisting of buckets of key value pairs, based on the hash created by the hashing algorithm. Then, I added get, add, hash, and contain methods to the hash table class and tested using Jest.
