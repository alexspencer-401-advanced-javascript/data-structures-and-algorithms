## Code Challenge | Trees

### Challenge Description
This challenge emphasized tree traversal, through preOrder(), inOrder(), and postOrder() methods within a binaryTree class. Further, it required recursive solutions when working with a binaryTreeSearch class that leveraged two solved methods, add(), and contains(). The goal of which was to add a new node in the correct location based on a given value, and to locate and return true if a node with a certain value was in the tree, and false if a node with a certain value was not in the tree. 

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach to this challenge was to identify the proper tree traversal method, and work accordingly based on the left, right, and root elements we established as a part of the Node and Tree classes. Further, the methods were solved with the assistance of many resources, as well as the use of recursive functions as the depth of the trees was unknown.
