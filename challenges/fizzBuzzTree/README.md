## Code Challenge | FizzBuzz Tree
The FizzBuzz tree challenge requires us to take in a tree as an argument, and then returns certain values depending on the values of the nodes found in that tree as one traverses. For example, we were to replace all numbers divisible by 3 with the word 'Fizz', the numbers divisible by 5 with the word 'Buzz', and those numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'. The objective of this challenge was to incorporate basic JavaScript logic with tree traversal and recursive functions. 

### Challenge Description
Please see above section. 

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach to this challenge was to leverage other methods used on other code challenges to assist with the formation of the recursive helper function. From there, it was a matter of plugging in the modulo logic for the number divisibility by 3, 5, or 15 and the corresponding results.
